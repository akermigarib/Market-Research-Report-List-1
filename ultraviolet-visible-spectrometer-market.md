<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultraviolet-Visible Spectrometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Beam</li><li>Double Beam</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) Spectrometer market is primarily divided into two types: single beam and double beam systems. Single beam spectrometers measure absorbance or transmittance of a sample by passing light through it and capturing the signal with a detector. They are simpler and more cost-effective but less stable over time. Double beam spectrometers, on the other hand, split the light into two paths, one for the sample and another for reference, providing better stability, accuracy, and higher precision for quantitative analysis.</p></p>
