<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photoresist Developer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Type</li><li>Negative Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The photoresist developer market is categorized primarily into positive and negative types. Positive photoresists become soluble when exposed to light, allowing areas of the substrate to be selectively developed and etched away, often used in semiconductor fabrication. Conversely, negative photoresists harden upon exposure to light, and the unexposed areas are washed away during development, creating a positive relief structure. Each type serves different applications in microelectronics and photolithography, influencing production processes and technological advancements in various industries.</p></p>
