<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sea Water Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Pumps</li><li>Positive Displacement Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The sea water pumps market primarily features two types: centrifugal pumps and positive displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps operate by converting rotational energy into fluid momentum, making them efficient for high-flow applications. They are ideal for transporting large volumes of seawater. In contrast, positive displacement pumps move fluid by trapping a fixed amount and forcing it into the discharge pipe, offering consistent flow rates and higher pressures, which is beneficial for applications requiring precise volume control and handling of seawater.</p></p>
